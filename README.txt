This is the PeptideBuilder library, written by Matthew A. Tien,
Dariya K. Sydykova, Austin G. Meyer, and Claus O. Wilke.

This directory contains 3 files, Geometry.py, PeptideBuilder.py,
and simpleExample.py. The first two constitute the PeptideBuilder
library. They need to be placed into the search path of your python
installation. The third is a brief example script demonstrating
basic use of the PeptideBuilder library.
