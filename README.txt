This is the PeptideBuilder library, written by Matthew A. Tien,
Dariya K. Sydykova, Austin G. Meyer, and Claus O. Wilke.

The software is provided to you under the GNU General Public
License, version 2.0 or later.

The files 'Geometry.py' and 'PeptideBuilder.py' constitute the PeptideBuilder
library. They need to be placed into the search path of your python
installation.

The file 'simpleExample.py' is a brief example script demonstrating
basic use of the PeptideBuilder library.

To test whether your installation works properly, run the script 'unitTests.py'
and compare the resulting output to the files in 'unitTests.expected'. On
a unix machine unix, the shell script 'runUnitTests.sh' will do that for you.
If the shell script doesn't find any differences (prints out only empty lines)
then everything is working correctly.

The script 'evaluation.py' reproduces the results presented in Table 1 of the
PeptideBuilder manuscript.
